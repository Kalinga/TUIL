The research project: How to write it (Ralph Berry)

The forms of bibliography cards for books

Author or authors and title
Below the call number should be written  the  name  of  the  author,
last  name  first,  followed  by  a
comma,  first  name(s)  or  initials,  followed  by  a  comma;  and  the
name of the book, underlined or italicized.
Examples

Lovejoy, A. O., The Great Chain of Being

Journal articles from the Internet

The recommended form is: author’s surname and initials; year of
publication,  if  given  (in  parentheses);  title  of  article  in  single
inverted  commas;  title  of  the  journal,  italicized  or  underlined;
followed by ‘Online’ in square brackets; followed by the volume
and issue number of the journal, if given. Then, as a new sentence,
‘Available from:’ and the website (URL) from which the material
was derived. This should be followed by the date it was accessed,
in square brackets.
