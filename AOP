Sommerville's Software Engineeering
Chapter #21
---------------------------------------

Aspect oriented software Engineering is different software engineering paradigm than conventional software enginerring
methodologies such as structural, object oriented, object based software engineering. Though it has its root in object
orineted software engineering it is not being used as widely as object oriented software engineering methods are used.
Aspect oriented software engineering is mainly achvied by "Aspect orineted programming". To achieve this new approach
of programming there shall be introduction of four new terminologies, for the understanding of the new semantics.

Many-to-many relationship exits between Requirements and Components in large systems.
Leads to the problem: small change in Requirements needs understanding and modifying multiple componets.
Preventing code Reuse: A component with core business logic, usually bundled with with system requirements e.g. Logging,
performance mesurement, etc..

And Aspect Oriented Programming/Engineering is an approach to software developement to address this problem.
Aspect oriented programming can help in writing reusable software components and develope easily maintainable softwares.
